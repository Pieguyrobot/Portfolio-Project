      <p class="cts-text"> I got my first job at the Christmas Tree Shops in greenwood around the end of september of 2021. I have been working this job for almost 9 months now as of July and hace learned a lot from this job. My role in this job is customer experience sales, this is basicaly what is called a "floor worker". As a floor worker we do tasks such as stocking, cleaning, organzing, helping customers and even time to time hop on the registers to try and get the line down. This job has taught me valuable soft skills such as communication, working with a team and perserverance. Juggling this with all my 4 ap classes last year I felt also made me a more timely organized person as I had to plan out my day and homework schedule around these 25-30 hrs a week. </p

      <p class="nextech-text"> As I said earlier, I got here because my friend AJ told me about this program. I applied and got accepted for the Catapult program of 22'. I thought it would be a good summer thing and it paid, meaning I wouldn't have to worry about losing money on gas to drive there. The payment was a mainly a plus, to be able to afford to take time off of my real job and work here was amazing. I knew a good amount of code before entering this program and after looking back at what I have created, I am glad I entered this program. This program allowed me to hear the stories of multiple people in the tech field and it's amazing to hear about it all because it gives me the hope that I can do the same. It also taught me that I can learn so much in 4 weeks, I took HTML before and I learned nothing close to this. Nextech was a blast to work with for the 4 week period and it felt almost like it went by too fast, showing how much I enjoyed it.  </p>
