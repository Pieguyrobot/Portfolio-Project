      <p class="cts-text"> I got my first job at the Christmas Tree Shops in Greenwood around the end of September of 2021. I have been working this job for almost 9 months now as of July and hace learned a lot from this job. My role is Customer Experience Sales, this just means I'm a "floor worker". As a floor worker we do tasks such as stocking, cleaning, organzing, helping customers and even time to time hop on the registers to try and get the line down. This job has taught me valuable soft skills such as communication, working with a team and perserverance. Juggling this with all 4 of my AP classes last year I felt made me more of a timely organized person as I had to plan out my day and homework schedule around these 25-30 hrs a week. </p

      <p class="nextech-text"> As I said earlier, I got here because my friend AJ told me about this program. I applied and got accepted for the Catapult program of '22. I thought it would be a great experience and the fact that it paid made it worth the drive and time. The payment really helped my ability to be able to take time off of my other job and work here. I knew a good amount of code before entering this program and after looking back at what I have created, I am glad I entered this program. This program allowed me to hear the stories of multiple people in the field and it was amazing to hear and gives me so much hope that I can accomplish the same. I also learned so much more than I expected in 4 weeks, I had taken an HTML course before and this blew it away. Nextech was a blast to work with for the 4 week period and it felt almost like it went by too fast, showing how much I enjoyed it.  </p>
